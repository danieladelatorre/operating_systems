Lab1-Unix/Linux Commands and Basic Shell Programming

Part 1 Observations:
the first code given to us prints all of my directories 
it also prints the location of my home directory followed by my username followed by the path. After that it prints the location of where I am in my directory. Finally, it prints "Hi ddelator! There are        2 users logged on.
Check who logged in!"

Part 2 Observations:
to fix this part of the code to tell me I could proceed, i modified the if else statement to print "Now you can proceed if the user isn't "salagtash".
Now that it doesn't exit, the program asks for the height and width of a rectangle and it calculates the area.

Part 3 Observations:
In order to make the program print the area of a circle, I put the value of 3.14159 in a variable called pi and in order to make the area a floating point value, i used bc which acts as a command line calculator that works for floating point numbers and I used the pipeline symbol | to connect the standard output of what's in quotes to the input of the bc and that value is stored in the variable area.
